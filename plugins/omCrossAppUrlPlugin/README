This plugin aims to simply resolve the problem of doing **cross app links** for Symfony 1.2. 

It's done using the symfony core classes and some context switch, so you can really use the routing defined in each application. 


# Usage 

This plugin provide an helper you can simply use as decribed [in the book](http://www.symfony-project.org/book/1_2/07-Inside-the-View-Layer#Helpers). For now just the url_for copycat is available : cross_app_url_for

    function cross_app_url_for($appname, $url, $absolute = 'false', $env = null, $debug = 'false')

Options are self-explanatory. $url is an internal uri as specified in the routing.ym off the $app application.

# TODO 
* investigate to check the overhead of the function
* try catch the context creation 
* dig more to find the adequat main controler (instead of lauching an exeception)

# Changelog
## 01/12/2008 
* initial realease - cross_app_url_for function
