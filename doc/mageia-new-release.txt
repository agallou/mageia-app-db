Listing here the steps just before a new Mageia is released:
* update the applications list from rpmdrake's gui.lst
** download latest rpmdrake rpm from cauldron
** extract it and get from it the /usr/share/rpmdrake/gui.lst file
** sort the file
** meld it with data/distros/mageia/applications.txt. We add new applications but never remove missing ones because they can exist in older versions of the distro. Remove one entry only if it's clearly misleading.
* give the comparison links for blog post
* fetch RPMs one last time from Sophie, then temporarily stop syncing from Sophie so that cache is preserved
* in distrelease, rename 'cauldron' to e.g. '5' and update the is_latest and is_previous fields in the table
* (to be confirmed) keep the is_dev_version field set to 1 for the former 'cauldron' entry
* make the "comparison" page not show newer versions from other distros, to not distract from comparison to previous release (gray lines can be frightening)
* give the comparison links for blog post
* restarting httpd and mysqld can do no harm and free some RAM

A few days later (when number of visits per day is low enough and Sophie has the new Mageia listed in it)
* add a new cauldron entry to distrelease table
* begin to sync from Sophie again with the --add option (which will, in the first run, download the whole list of packages in cauldron)
